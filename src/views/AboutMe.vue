          Hi and welcome ðŸ’«
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m Louise (she/her) and I have been interested in computer science ever since I took an extra credit class
          learning
          Component Pascal during my Bachelor of Arts degree. After obtaining my Japanese & English degree, I started
          learning software development in <a href="https://42.fr/en/homepage/" target="_blank">42 Paris</a> in the hope
          of
          one day creating video games that make people feel âœ¨feelsâœ¨
        </p>
        <p>
          I have since worked on several gaming
          <router-link to="/">projects</router-link>
          both for school and fun, and also been employed as a .NET developer during 3 years in a Swiss tech
          company.
          Iâ€™m currently a game programmer at <a href="https://ouatstudios.net/">OuatStudios</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Iâ€™m not developing or playing games, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, cats, and plants. I also
          like reading, drinking tea, and climbing.
        </p>
