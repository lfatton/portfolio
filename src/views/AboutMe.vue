        Hi and welcome ðŸ’«
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m Louise (she/her) and I have been interested in computer science ever since I took an extra credit class
        learning
        Component Pascal during my Bachelor of Artsâ€™ degree. After obtaining my Japanese & English degree, I started
        learning software development in <a href="https://42.fr/en/homepage/" target="_blank">42 Paris</a> in the hope
        of
        one day creating video games that make people feel âœ¨feelsâœ¨
      </p>
      <p>
        I have since worked on several gaming
        <router-link to="/">projects</router-link>
        both for school and fun, and also been employed as a full-stack developer during 3 years in a Swiss tech
        company.
        Iâ€™m currently looking for work in the gaming industry, donâ€™t hesitate to take a look at my <a
          href="../../static/Resume_Louise_Fatton.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> and/or <a
          href="mailto:louise.fatton@hotmail.fr">get in touch</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first games I played were on GameBoy and I think itâ€™s probably why my favourite type of games is 2D
        (especially
        ones like Stardew Valley â™¥), even if I enjoy the occasional Horizon or Assassinâ€™s Creed game. The genre Iâ€™m
        least
        comfortable with is probably FPS, which is quite ironic as the project Iâ€™ve spent most time on (6 months) was a
        game based on a mix of 93 Doom and Duke Nukem 3D. I still very much enjoyed developing it but unfortunately
        wasn't its most efficient tester.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Iâ€™m not developing or playing games, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, cats, and plants. I also
        like reading, drinking tea, and pole dancing.
